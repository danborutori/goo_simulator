# Project Title

Goo Simulator

## Description

In this simulation, the goo substance is represented by a collection of particles or vertices connected by springs, forming a flexible and deformable structure. The Three.js library is used to render and animate the goo, allowing users to interact with it in real-time.

The Three-BVH-Mesh algorithm, short for Bounding Volume Hierarchy Mesh, is employed for efficient collision detection within the simulation. This algorithm partitions the goo's mesh into a hierarchical tree structure, enabling fast and accurate detection of collisions with other objects or surfaces within the environment.
